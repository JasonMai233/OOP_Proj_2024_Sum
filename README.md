Title: Car rental system


Team Member details: Jason Mai, Ethan Kim


Description of project: 
This project will simulate a car rental system, where the renters can find available cars within a database and rent them accordingly, and the employees can manage the request and database.


List of proposed features:
 a renter interface that
requires log in
Can browse cars
Can make request to rent a car
an employee interface that
requires log in
Can browse cars
Can reject/accept requests from renters
Can add/ delete cars to/from the database
Can edit information of existing cars
a database that 
Stores information of all cars and updates when 
cars were being rented and returned
Cars were being added or deleted
A request was made and being rejected or accepted
Stores renter and employee information

Additional notes
As for payment, I felt like implementing it in a simulated system like this is kinda unnecessary, as we can’t really create a “real-payment-like” experience here without the help of outside sources, which I think is going too far. If doing a pure “simulated” payment, that will just be another interface with a simple button, which I think is also unnecessary to create.
